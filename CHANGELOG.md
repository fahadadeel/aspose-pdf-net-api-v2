# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-06-10
### Added
- Feature flag mechanism — single registry at `resources/feature_flags.json` declares every boolean behaviour toggle the pipeline understands (11 flags initially: `use_own_llm`, `use_retrieve_on_llm_fail`, `decompose_on_llm_fail`, `final_llm_after_regen_fail`, `auto_learn_on_success`, `auto_learn_catalog`, `learn_rules_from_failures`, `update_agents_md`, `resume_batch`, `reporting_enabled`, `reporting_log_to_file`) with owner, default, env-var name, scope, and date-added. New `features/` module exposes `is_enabled()`, `get_flag()`, `list_flags()`, `snapshot()`, `refresh()`. `load_config()` in `config.py` now resolves the seven pipeline-scope toggles through the registry (env-var overrides still work — same env-var names). New read-only `GET /api/feature-flags` endpoint surfaces the registry with resolved values for ops/deployment verification. 16 new tests across `tests/test_features.py` and `tests/integration/test_feature_flags_endpoint.py`. Operator guide at `docs/feature-flags.md`
- Mutation testing via `mutmut==3.6.0` — new `mutation-tests` CI job in a dedicated `mutation` stage, gated to scheduled runs only (`$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule" && $RUN_MUTATION_TESTS == "true"`). Active cadence: weekly Thursdays 12:55 Asia/Karachi (`55 12 * * 4`), configured via GitLab Pipeline Schedule. Initial scope: 7 stable high-coverage modules (`pipeline/error_parser.py`, `pipeline/prompt_builder.py`, `pipeline/models.py`, `middleware/security.py`, `knowledge/error_fixes.py`, `knowledge/pattern_tracker.py`, `routers/health.py`). Output uploaded as a 30-day artifact, informational only — never blocks merges
- `setup.cfg` introduced with a minimal `[mutmut]` config (source paths, pytest args, timeouts, coverage-only mutation)
- `make mutation` target for local runs
- `docs/mutation-testing.md` — operator guide covering how it works, safety guarantees, schedule setup, report interpretation, and scope-expansion criteria
- `.gitignore` entries for `mutants/`, `mutmut-report.txt`, `.mutmut-cache`


### Changed
- Policy drift check is now **blocking** in CI — removed the `|| true` wrapper from `.gitlab-ci.yml` after verifying the `POLICY_DRIFT_TOKEN` CI variable injects correctly on protected `main` runs. Live config matches `policy/gitlab-branch-protection-main.json` on every tracked field
- `scripts/check_policy_drift.py` treats "all providers skipped" as a non-fatal warning by default (common on MR branches when `POLICY_DRIFT_TOKEN` is `Protected`-only); pass `--require-tokens` to make it fatal. Real drift still fails the build

### Added
- `scripts/check_policy_drift.py` — policy-as-code drift detector. Reads `policy/*.json` and the live branch protection config from the GitHub and GitLab APIs, then reports a per-field diff. Wired into `.gitlab-ci.yml` as an informational step (non-blocking) so we can promote to blocking once the `POLICY_DRIFT_TOKEN` CI variable is configured
- `agents.md` Self-Learning section rewritten to document the **feedback-driven strategy evolution across runs**: 6-step observe → extract → persist → promote → reuse → review loop with concrete file references for `auto_learner`, `auto_fixes`, `auto_error_catalog`, `pattern_tracker`, `error_fixes`, and `rule_search.compute_adaptive_top_k`. New **Adaptive Mid-Run Behaviour** subsection covers stage escalation, bounded retries, and dynamic rule-search widening

### Security / Fixed
- `config.py`: removed hardcoded local path `/Users/fahadadeelqazi/...` from the `repo_path` default (leaked PII; now defaults to empty string and must be set via `REPO_PATH`)
- `scan_repo()` in `git_ops/repo_docs.py`: returns empty dict when `REPO_PATH` is unset or points at a missing directory instead of raising `FileNotFoundError` — fixes CI crash in the contract test for `/api/repo-categories`

### Added
- Contract tests with `schemathesis==4.21.3` — `tests/integration/test_contract.py` loads the live OpenAPI schema from the ASGI app and generates property-based requests for every documented endpoint. Currently runs against an allowlist of 6 well-defined READ-ONLY endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/version`, `/api/metrics`, `/api/auto-fixes`, `/api/results`, `/api/repo-categories`); 32 endpoints are deliberately skipped pending schema tightening (listed in `_TODO_PATHS`). Foundation for full contract coverage as endpoint response models get explicit
- `scripts/export_openapi.py` — dumps the FastAPI OpenAPI schema to `docs/openapi.json` for repo-browsable API contract. Wired into GitLab CI as an artifact (30-day retention)
- `docs/openapi.json` — committed snapshot of the API contract (38 endpoints, 41 KB)

### Changed
- `requirements.txt` switched from ranged version pins (`>=current,<next_major`) to exact pins (`==`) for reproducible builds. `python-multipart` bumped to `0.0.27` and `requests` to `2.33.0` to clear the CVEs flagged by `pip-audit`. Dependabot will continue to propose minor/major bumps as PRs
- `requirements-ci.txt` — added `schemathesis==4.21.3`

## [Unreleased] - 2026-06-09
### Security
- Removed hardcoded `LITELLM_API_KEY` default from `config.py` — key now loads exclusively from the `LITELLM_API_KEY` env var
- Replaced CORS `allow_origins=["*"]` wildcard in `main.py` with explicit origins from a new `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (defaults to `localhost:7103`)
- Moved `reporting.py` endpoint token from URL query string to `Authorization: Bearer` header to prevent leakage via logs/proxies
- Scrubbed previously committed `LITELLM_API_KEY` from all of git history via `git filter-repo` and force-pushed to both remotes
- Added `bandit` SAST scanner and `pip-audit` dependency vulnerability scan as required CI steps on both GitHub Actions and GitLab CI; bandit config in `bandit.yaml`
- Marked SHA1 slug hash in `git_ops/committer.py` as `usedforsecurity=False` to reflect it's only used for filename truncation, not security
- New `middleware/security.py` with two middlewares wired into `main.py`:
  - `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `Permissions-Policy` (geo/mic/camera disabled), and `Strict-Transport-Security` to every response
  - `APIKeyMiddleware` optionally gates `/api/*` behind `X-API-Key` or `Authorization: Bearer` when the new `API_KEY` env var is set; no-op when unset to keep local dev frictionless. `/api/health`, `/`, `/results`, `/results-v2` remain public for monitoring/UI
- Type checking with `mypy==2.1.0` — added `mypy.ini` (lenient config, strict_optional disabled), wired as non-blocking CI step in GitHub Actions and GitLab CI, and `make typecheck` target
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — local hooks for ruff, bandit, trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixer, large-file guard, private-key detection
- `/api/metrics` endpoint — uptime, active/paused/completed/failed job counts, total examples processed, pass rate percentage. Lightweight observability without Prometheus dependency
- `/api/version` endpoint — service version, NuGet version, .NET TFM for deployment verification
- `make security` target — runs bandit + pip-audit locally with same flags as CI
- Branch protection enabled on `main` (GitHub): blocks direct pushes, requires `test` status check, disables force pushes and deletions, requires conversation resolution before merge
- `policy/` directory introduced as policy-as-code: `policy/github-branch-protection-main.json` is the exact API body applied to GitHub via `gh api --method PUT`; `policy/README.md` documents how to apply and verify
- `docs/branch-protection.md` — human-readable branch protection policy for both GitHub and GitLab, with the documented bypass procedure for secret-history rewrites
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — new "Branch Protection & PR Workflow" section linking the protection policy and PR template
- `docs/runbook.md` — secret rotation step 5 now links to the bypass procedure in `docs/branch-protection.md`

### Added
- Auto-generated GitHub Release notes (`git_ops/release_notes.py`) — diffs `index.json` between release branch and main to produce a rich release body with summary table, new/updated categories, and full category breakdown. Wired into `run_version_bump()` and `run_promote_to_main()` in `jobs.py`
- **Update README** button on Results Dashboard + new `POST /api/update-readme` endpoint — scans live repo file counts, regenerates `README.md` with the improved Agentic format, and pushes directly to the examples repo (no PR)
- `docs/runbook.md` — operations runbook with SLA targets, severity definitions, on-call contacts, 6 common failure scenarios with mitigation steps, rollback procedure, and secret rotation steps
- `CORS_ORIGINS` env var documented in `.env.example` and `.claude/rules/env-vars.md`
- New `tests/integration/` suite — `test_app_integration.py` (full-app FastAPI boot, CORS, MCP mount, `/api/update-readme`); `test_router_endpoints.py` (42 router endpoint scenarios); `test_middleware.py` (9 security header / API key scenarios); `test_metrics_endpoints.py` (7 scenarios for `/api/health`, `/api/version`, `/api/metrics`). Pushed `routers/jobs.py` coverage from 22% to 62%, `routers/health.py` to 95%, and total coverage from 51% to 66.6%
- README CI/quality badges (CI, coverage, tests, ruff, bandit, Python version, .NET framework version)
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability reporting policy with 48-hour ack SLA, supported versions, and links to security controls
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — weekly grouped dependency updates for `pip` and `github-actions` ecosystems with separate runtime/dev groups
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request}.md` — standardized PR/issue formats
- `docs/ownership.md` — operational accountability doc with team contacts, component owners, RACI matrix, and escalation path
- Expanded `CONTRIBUTING.md` with a **Testing** section (test layers table — unit, integration, planned contract + mutation), **Quality Gates** section enumerating the 5 CI checks every PR runs, optional pre-commit setup, and a **Related Documentation** index linking architecture, deployment, runbook, ownership, and security policy

### Changed
- `generate_readme()` in `git_ops/repo_docs.py` refactored — now produces the improved Agentic format with "For AI Coding Agents" section, category table with `agents.md` links, and the **Agentic .NET Ecosystem** table linking all 7 sibling repos (Words, Cells, HTML, Imaging, Slides, Email, BarCode); ecosystem list extracted to `_ECOSYSTEM_REPOS` constant
- `pytest.ini` — coverage gate raised to `--cov-fail-under=60` (current 64%)
- `API_KEY` env var added to `.env.example` and `.claude/rules/env-vars.md`
- Updated `aspose-pdf/agentic-net-examples` repo description to start with "Agentic, build-validated..." and expanded GitHub topics to 20 (added `agentic`, `agentic-ai`, `llm`, `mcp`, `generative-ai`, `pdf-conversion`, `pdf-editing`, `pdf-forms`, `pdf-annotations`, `digital-signatures`) for better discoverability
- Expanded `.github/CODEOWNERS` with per-component path mappings (pipeline, knowledge, git_ops, routers, CI, security, docs) so PR reviews are routed to the right owner

## [Unreleased] - 2026-06-02
### Fixed
- Pinned `scipy<1.16.0` to fix pipeline crash during KB load — scipy 1.16+ introduced an internal assertion (`"Warnings too long"`) triggered on `sentence_transformers` import, killing Stage 3+ jobs
- Wrapped `PipelineRunner.execute()` in try/except so unhandled exceptions return a `FAILED` result instead of crashing the job thread

### Added
- MCP server at `/mcp` via `fastapi-mcp` — standard Model Context Protocol, works with any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue.dev, etc.)
- `mcp_config.example.json` — ready-to-use client configuration
- `Makefile` with targets: `run`, `run-reload`, `install`, `install-ci`, `lint`, `lint-fix`, `test`, `test-fast`, `check`, `build-image`, `env`
- `ruff.toml` — ruff linter config (E/F rules, line-length 120, py312 target)

### Changed
- Version-pinned all `requirements.txt` entries with `>=current,<next_major`
- `requirements-ci.txt` uses exact `==` pins for reproducibility; added `ruff`
- CI (GitLab + GitHub Actions) now enforces zero ruff violations before tests
- Updated `agents.md`: added MCP interface capability, corrected test counts (117 tests across 11 files)
